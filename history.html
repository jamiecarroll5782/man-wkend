<section><p>Who would have thought that a late TV shipment would create Man Weekend?! The year was 2007, I ordered a brand new 32" flat screen TV and thought I was going to get it in time for Superbowl XLI. Since flat screen TV's were relatively new, I forked out over $800 for this bad boy, and that was a STEAL!</p>
    <p>Since my TV arrived on the Monday after Superbowl, I had to figure out a new time to get everyone together to check out the TV. The first 4 days of March Madness instantly came to mind, and then another thought came to mind... my wife was out of town that whole weekend, from Thursday to Saturday.</p></section>
